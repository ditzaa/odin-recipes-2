# odin-recipes
This is a very simple website with a couple of recipes that is built with very basic HTML 5.

The objective of this project is to solidify basic HTML concepts such as elements and tags, the HTML boilerplate, working with text, lists and links and images. 

Additionally to the first recipes project, this one has a little more style, because I used some CSS features to modify the color of the background and of the text, the font-family and the font-size and center the text of the main page.
